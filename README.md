## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- State Management: I had difficulties managing state across different components and ensuring that the data was correctly updated and shared among them.
- Conditional Rendering: I faced challenges in rendering different components and buttons based on the current step of the form, especially when implementing "Go Back" and "Next Step" functionality.
- Form Validation: Implementing form validation proved to be tricky. I struggled with checking if input fields were empty and verifying if the values were of the correct type. Handling and displaying validation errors was a challenge.
- Responsive Design: Making the form responsive for both mobile and desktop views was challenging. I had to adjust the positioning of elements and styles based on the screen size.
- LocalStorage: Storing data in the localStorage and keeping it in sync with the form's state presented challenges, especially when dealing with complex data structures.
- TypeScript Errors: I encountered TypeScript errors, including issues related to object types and incorrect data types in conditional statements. These errors required debugging and adjustments to my code.

### Continued development
- I will improve on the input validation for in 'Personal Form'.
- I will improve the responsiveness of the project, taking into consideration more breakpoints.
